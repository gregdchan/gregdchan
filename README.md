### Hi, I'm Greg! ðŸ‘‹
Pronouns: He, Him

Iâ€™m a Guyana-born, US-based technologist, interdisciplinary designer, and entrepreneur, with a growing interest in Design Thinking. 

Day job: Technology and Media Services at NYU Tisch, Undergraduate Drama. 

Most recently: I graduated Cohort B of NYU Tisch + Shanghai Joint Global Interactive Media Arts Low Residency Masters Program and Cohort 8 of Communitas Ventures Accelerator (on the same day!). 

In the last year: I've researched special interest topics such as Accessibility, US Cannabis Culture, and Indigenous/Caribbean Futures, while applying a range of emerging technology to explore digital experiences and practical, interactive solutions. 

Sidehustle: Noticing a major gap in well-designed tools for cannabis use, I founded For Grownups Inc in May 2022 where I'm currently developing several patent-pending home storage and usage solutions. For Grownups aims create modern products that tackle currently emerging problems in the cannabis industry, particularly around home safety and usage management.

Additionally I consult for individuals and brands seeking to use emerging technology creatively.

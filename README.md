### Hi, I'm Greg! ðŸ‘‹
Pronouns: He, Him
<br><br>
Iâ€™m a Guyana-born, US-based technologist, interdisciplinary designer, and entrepreneur, with a growing interest in Design Thinking. 

Most recently: I graduated Cohort B of NYU Tisch + Shanghai Joint Global Interactive Media Arts Low Residency Masters Program and Cohort 8 of Communitas Ventures Accelerator (on the same day!). 

In the last year: I've researched special interest topics such as Accessibility, US Cannabis Culture, and Indigenous/Caribbean Futures, while applying a range of emerging technology to explore digital experiences and practical, interactive solutions. 

Noticing a major gap in safe usage tools for cannabis, I founded For Grownups Inc in May 2022 where I'm currently developing several patent-pending products.

Stuff I know: UX Design, VR Development, Physical computing/prototyping, Usability Research, HTML, CSS, JS, Node, ML5, TensorFlow, Unity, C, C#, C++

Stuff I'm learning: Interaction Design, React, Svelte, Web3.js, RESTful APIs
